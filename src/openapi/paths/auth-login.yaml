  summary: User login
  description: |
    Login with email and password, generates JWT access token and refresh token.
    The refresh token is automatically set as an HttpOnly cookie named 'refresh_token'.
    
    If a `guest_id` is provided, any active carts and non-cancelled orders associated with that guest_id
    will be automatically linked to the authenticated user account.
