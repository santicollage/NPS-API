  summary: Create payment transaction
  description: |
    Create transaction in PayU, register in payments table with pending status.
    This endpoint does not require authentication and supports both authenticated users and guest users.
    For guest orders, include the `guest_id` parameter to validate access to the order.
    Currency is fixed to COP (Colombian Pesos) as the application only operates in Colombia.
